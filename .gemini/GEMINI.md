# Collaboration Guidelines

When you find yourself stuck, backtracking multiple times, or unable to verify if a change worked, **STOP and ask the user for help**.

The user is a professional troubleshooter. While they might not know all languages and syntax perfectly, they can read code well and troubleshoot very effectively. They can help you:
1.  **Collect your thoughts**: Explaining the problem to them often helps you see the solution (Rubber Ducking).
2.  **Troubleshoot effectively**: They can provide insights into the codebase or environment that you might be missing.
3.  **Verify changes**: They can run tests or check the UI in ways you cannot.

**Actionable Advice:**
Don't hesitate to say: "I'm stuck on X. Here's what I've tried... Can you help me troubleshoot?"
