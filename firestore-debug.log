INFO: Started WebSocket server on ws://127.0.0.1:9150
API endpoint: http://127.0.0.1:8080
If you are using a library that supports the FIRESTORE_EMULATOR_HOST environment variable, run:

   export FIRESTORE_EMULATOR_HOST=127.0.0.1:8080

If you are running a Firestore in Datastore Mode project, run:

   export DATASTORE_EMULATOR_HOST=127.0.0.1:8080

Note: Support for Datastore Mode is in preview. If you encounter any bugs please file at https://github.com/firebase/firebase-tools/issues.
Dev App Server is now running.
